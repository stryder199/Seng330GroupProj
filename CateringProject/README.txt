-----Getting started-----

The username/password we would like you to use is root/admin.
When you get into the system you can make your own account in the system admin tab.(Don't worry we keep your password as MD5 encryption so even we don't know what it is!)

We hope you have as much fun exploring our project as we had when we made it!
